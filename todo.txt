Requirements:
x move file
x rename file
x sequence number component
x chop off header
x sequence number incrementing in the filer
x pass deployed environment in from command line.
x error handling (like missing files and directories)
* output/logging
* script to run it correctly
* make the FileExists.ensure method a groovy helper
* make the FileTrimmer.removeFirstLine method a groovy helper

Improvements:
* archiving processed files?
* parametrize the DeployedEnvironment value
* chop off header specifically - not just first line.
* don't increment sequence number if there is no files.
