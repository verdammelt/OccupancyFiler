Requirements:
x move file
x rename file
x sequence number component
x chop off header
x sequence number incrementing in the filer
x pass deployed environment in from command line.
x error handling (like missing files and directories)
x output/logging
x script to run it correctly
x remove direct File code from SequenceNumber
* pull file path generation into a helper class
* collect reader,writer,deleter into a single helper class
* make the FileExists.ensure method a groovy helper
* make the FileTrimmer.removeFirstLine method a groovy helper

Improvements:
* archiving processed files?
x parametrize the DeployedEnvironment value
* chop off header specifically - not just first line.
x don't increment sequence number if there is no files.
* code review / cleanup - could be better.
