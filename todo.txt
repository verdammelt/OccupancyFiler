Requirements:
x move file
x rename file
x sequence number component
x chop off header
x sequence number incrementing in the filer
x pass deployed environment in from command line.
x error handling (like missing files and directories)
x output/logging
x script to run it correctly
x remove direct File code from SequenceNumber
x pull file path generation into a helper class
x parametrize the DeployedEnvironment value
x chop off header specifically - not just first line.
x don't increment sequence number if there is no files.

Improvements:
* archiving processed files?
* make the FileExists.ensure method a groovy helper
* make the FileTrimmer.removeFirstLine method a groovy helper
* collect reader,writer,deleter into a single helper class
* Keep moving all File usages up to the top
* Split filer - the tests seem to be telling me it has two responsibilities
    1) generate sequence number for each file in input and delete them after processing
    2) process each file
* inject logging so we can turn it off for testing.
